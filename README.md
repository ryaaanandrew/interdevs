# interdevs
Interdevs is a small project I am currently working on. Potential employers can browse through a list of great devs for possible internships. If a potential employer finds a candidate they'd like to interview, they can shoot them a message requesting a meeting.

created with React(context, hooks), Node.JS(Express) & GraphQL(Apollo)
